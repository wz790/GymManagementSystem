# üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Gym Management System

Building a gym management app with Avalonia because I got tired of Windows-only software. This is my first real desktop project and I'm learning as I go.

## Why This Exists

I work at a small gym and we're stuck with this ancient Windows program that crashes all the time. The owner wants something that works on his Mac too, so I figured why not build it myself and learn something new?

Avalonia seemed perfect since it lets me write once and run everywhere. Plus I wanted to get away from WPF after my last project was a nightmare.

## What I Want to Build

Nothing fancy right now, just the basics:

- Add gym members without the app crashing
- Track who paid their membership 
- See when memberships expire
- Maybe some basic reports if I get that far
- Login system so random people can't mess with the data

That's it. I'm not trying to build the next big thing, just something that actually works.

## My Setup

- **Avalonia UI** - Because cross-platform is the future
- **C# with .NET 9** - Might as well use the latest stuff
- **SQLite** - Simple database, no server headaches
- **Rider** - VS Code was driving me nuts, Rider just works

## Want to Help?

Honestly, I'm making this up as I go. If you know Avalonia or have ideas for gym software, feel free to:

1. Fork this thing
2. Fix whatever I broke
3. Send me a pull request
4. I'll probably accept it because you know more than me

## Legal Stuff

GPL v3 license. Use it, change it, whatever. Just keep it open source if you share it around.
